				The domain of video games has long been dominated by 4 major company camps: Sony’s Playstation,
				Microsoft’s XBox, Nintendo and Valve’s Steam (PC). Our visualization project explores a dataset of
				around 16000 Video Games (with a focus on around 8000) across almost 4 decades and illustrates the
				development of this “Console War”. Our application consists of 4 distinct views and visualization begins
				with a scrollytelling view that provides an overview and statistical summary of the major companies. The
				application then proceeds to the Main page that focuses on sales numbers and allows users to select and
				filter games based on other attributes like years, genres and rating scores. Users of this application
				explore the dataset casually to enjoy and perhaps look up how their favourite franchise performs
				compared to other games. Users can also discover patterns and compare trends of how genres interact with
				different console companies, and how they influence the sales numbers. We believe this visualization can
				help users, both casual and experts, to visualize patterns in sales of Video Games.<br />
